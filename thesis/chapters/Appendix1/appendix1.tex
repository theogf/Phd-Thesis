\chapter{Additional works} 

The following works do not fit the storyline of the thesis and are presented here.
They include a solo project around the choice of inducing points and a joint work with a master student on evidence estimation using \ac{SVGD}.
They were not extended further due to a lack of time and/or inconclusive results.
Both were reviewed and accepted into workshops.
