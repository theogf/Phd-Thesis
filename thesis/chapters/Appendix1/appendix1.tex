\label{appendix:worshoppapers}
The following work does not fit the storyline of the thesis and is therefore presented here only.
It was extended further due to a lack of time and/or inconclusive results.

\section{Adaptive Inducing Points Selection for Gaussian Processes}

Two important questions raised when using the inducing sparse \ac{GPs} are: how should the inducing points be located and how many points do I need to reach my desired level of accuracy?
This work tries to answer this by creating an adaptive algorithm which also works in an online setting.
A final paper was never written as the parameters regulating the inducing point selection is extremely correlated with the model parameters, and it was complicated to produce a stable algorithm.
