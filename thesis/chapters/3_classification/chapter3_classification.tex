Prior to the beginning of this doctoral studies, I worked on extending the work of \citet{henaoBayesianNonlinearSupport2014} to \ac{GPs} as well as scaling them up to big data \cite{wenzel2017bayesian}.
This work is not included in this thesis as it was prior to the start of my PhD.
This was the first introduction to the world of augmentations, incidentally this lead to the following work with Pr. Opper on the P\`olya-Gamma augmentation for logistic functions.
This following paper extends the work of \citet{polsonBayesianInferenceLogistic2012} on using augmentation variable to \ac{GPs} as well and effectively compare it with state-of-the-art method for inference with \ac{GPs} obtain a conditionally conjugate likelihood to a Gaussian prior.
