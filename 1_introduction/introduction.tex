Machine learning has become a wide field of research with a variety of sub-fields, each dedicated to solve various problems in different ways.
One field in particular, usually called probabilistic machine learning aims at representing the statistical side of the different models.


\section{Following Bayes}

\begin{itemize}
\item Bayes is awesome
\end{itemize}

In this thesis we are going to follow Bayesian principles

\section{The use of Gaussian Processes}

\begin{itemize}
\item All these things you can do with Gaussian processes
\end{itemize}

\section{The underestimated importance of representation}

\begin{itemize}
\item Different representation lead to very different results, efficiency etc
\end{itemize}
